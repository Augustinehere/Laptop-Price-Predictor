# Laptop-Price-Predictor
Hello Everyone!
This a project, as one can say by the name of it

I made  statistical machine learning model that helps to predict the price of a laptop based on certain specifications according to you.
It shows various options that are available to one when buying a laptop.
The Website is pretty straight-forward and to the point.
It directly asks you to select the options you want in your laptop from a drop down menu and ulimately you need to click on predict option to see the result and act accordingly.

[DISCLAIMER: THe project is based on older data so prices might be a little older as of now, as we know laptop prices changes rapidly and quite often so this is just a demo on how to make a model of this kind and check for accuracy and deploy]

Thank you!
Hope you like it.
